## Redis Integration

### 1. Installation (Ubuntu 24.04)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server -y
```

### 2. Configuration

Edit `/etc/redis/redis.conf`:

```conf
bind 127.0.0.1
requirepass YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD_HERE 
maxmemory 256mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

Restart Redis:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
sudo systemctl restart redis-server
```

Verify connection:

```bash
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -a YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD_HERE ping
# Should return: PONG
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Add to `backend/.env` (never commit your production password):

```env
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD_HERE
```

### 4. Redis Client (`backend/config/redisClient.js`)

```javascript
const Redis = require('ioredis');
const dotenv = require('dotenv');

dotenv.config();

let redis;
let redisAvailable = false;

if (process.env.REDIS_HOST && process.env.REDIS_PORT && process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD) {
  redis = new Redis({
    host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
    port: parseInt(process.env.REDIS_PORT, 10),
    password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
    tls: false, // Assuming localhost binding
    // Optional: Add retry strategy, etc.
  });

  redis.on('connect', () => {
    console.log('‚úÖ Connected to Redis');
    redisAvailable = true;
  });

  redis.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Redis connection error:', err.message);
    redisAvailable = false;
  });
} else {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Redis not configured - running without caching.');
}

async function getCache(key) {
  if (!redisAvailable || !redis) return null;
  try {
    const data = await redis.get(key);
    return data ? JSON.parse(data) : null;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Redis GET error for key ${key}:`, err.message);
    return null;
  }
}

async function setCache(key, value, ttlSeconds = 60) {
  if (!redisAvailable || !redis) return;
  try {
    await redis.set(key, JSON.stringify(value), 'EX', ttlSeconds);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Redis SET error for key ${key}:`, err.message);
  }
}

module.exports = {
  redis: redisAvailable ? redis : null,
  getCache,
  setCache,
  isRedisAvailable: () => redisAvailable,
};
```

### 5. Caching Example (User Role Lookup)

In `backend/routes/userRoutes.js`, the `/api/users/getRole/:userId` route first checks Redis:

```javascript
// At the top of userRoutes.js
const { getCache, setCache } = require('../config/redisClient');

// Inside the /getRole/:userId handler
const cacheKey = `role:${userId}`;
try {
  const cachedRoleInfo = await getCache(cacheKey);
  if (cachedRoleInfo) {
    return res.json(cachedRoleInfo);
  }
} catch (redisErr) {
  console.error(`Redis GET error for ${cacheKey}:`, redisErr.message);
}

// ... (Supabase lookup logic) ...

// After successful Supabase lookup and before returning response:
if (roleInfo) {
  try {
    await setCache(cacheKey, roleInfo, 60); // Cache for 60 seconds
  } catch (rcErr) {
    console.error(`Redis SET error for ${cacheKey}:`, rcErr.message);
  }
  return res.json(roleInfo);
}
```

If Redis is down or a key is not found, the code gracefully falls back to Supabase.
