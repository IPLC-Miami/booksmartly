## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User Registration ‚Üí Supabase Auth ‚Üí Email Verification
2. User Login ‚Üí Supabase Auth ‚Üí JWT Token + Role Assignment
3. API Requests ‚Üí JWT Validation ‚Üí Role-Based Access Check
4. Real-time ‚Üí Supabase RLS ‚Üí User-Filtered Data
```

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- New auth-enabled tables
CREATE TABLE auth.users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('client', 'clinician', 'admin')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Link existing tables to auth users
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE clinicians ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE receptions ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);

-- Chat messages with proper auth
CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  sender_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  recipient_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
```sql
-- Clients can only see their own data
CREATE POLICY "clients_own_data" ON clients
  FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Clinicians can see assigned patients + own data
CREATE POLICY "clinicians_assigned_data" ON clients
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM appointments 
      WHERE client_id = clients.id 
      AND clinician_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM clinicians WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      )
    )
  );

-- Admins can see everything
CREATE POLICY "admin_full_access" ON clients
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM auth.users 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Chat messages: users can see messages they sent or received
CREATE POLICY "chat_access" ON chat_messages
  FOR ALL USING (
    sender_id = auth.uid() OR recipient_id = auth.uid()
  );
```

   - Add user_id foreign keys to existing tables
   - Implement RLS policies for all tables

3. **Seed Data**
   - Create test accounts for each role
   - Link existing data to new user accounts
   - Verify RLS policies work correctly

### Phase 2: Backend Auth Integration
1. **JWT Middleware**
   - Create token validation middleware
   - Extract user role from JWT claims
   - Implement role-based route protection

2. **Auth Routes**
   - Sign up with role assignment
   - Sign in with role-based redirects
   - Password reset and email verification
   - User profile management

3. **API Security**
   - Add auth middleware to all protected routes
   - Implement user-specific data filtering
   - Add role-based endpoint access control

### Phase 3: Frontend Auth Components

   - User state management with React Context
   - JWT token storage and refresh logic
   - Role-based UI rendering

## üîê SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### JWT Token Management
- **Storage:** HttpOnly cookies for web, secure storage for mobile
- **Expiration:** 1 hour access tokens, 7 day refresh tokens
- **Refresh:** Automatic token refresh before expiration
- **Revocation:** Server-side token blacklisting capability

### Password Security
- **Requirements:** Minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers
- **Hashing:** Supabase handles bcrypt hashing automatically
- **Reset:** Secure email-based reset with time-limited tokens
- **Verification:** Email verification required for new accounts

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- **CORS:** Proper CORS configuration for frontend domains
- **Headers:** Security headers (CSRF, XSS protection)
- **Validation:** Input validation and sanitization

### Database Security
- **RLS:** Row Level Security on all user-accessible tables
- **Policies:** Granular policies for each role and operation
- **Audit:** Audit logging for sensitive operations
- **Backup:** Regular encrypted backups with access controls

1. User visits registration page
2. Selects role (client/clinician) - admin created by existing admin
3. Enters email, password, basic info
4. Receives email verification link
5. Clicks verification ‚Üí account activated
6. Redirected to role-appropriate dashboard

### Login Flow
1. User enters email/password
2. Supabase validates credentials
3. JWT token issued with role claims
4. Frontend stores token securely
5. User redirected to role-appropriate dashboard
6. Token automatically refreshed as needed

### Password Reset Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot Password"
2. Enters email address
3. Receives reset email with secure link
4. Clicks link ‚Üí redirected to reset page
5. Enters new password
6. Password updated ‚Üí redirected to login

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Environment Configuration
- **Development:** Local Supabase instance for testing
- **Production:** Hosted Supabase with proper security settings
- **Secrets:** All auth secrets managed via VPS environment variables
- **Auto-deploy:** Code changes trigger automatic deployment

### Migration Strategy
1. **Database:** Apply migrations via Supabase CLI
2. **Frontend:** Deploy new auth components with feature flags
3. **Backend:** Deploy new auth middleware with backward compatibility
4. **Cutover:** Enable new auth system and disable old mocks
5. **Verification:** Run automated tests to verify all flows work

### Rollback Plan
- **Database:** Maintain migration rollback scripts
- **Code:** Feature flags allow instant rollback to mock auth
- **Data:** Backup user data before migration
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite to catch issues early
