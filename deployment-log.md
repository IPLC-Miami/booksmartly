**Date**: June 12, 2025  
**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Task**: Lay Core Scheduling Foundations

### Overview
The core scheduling foundations for BookSmartly have been successfully implemented, enabling patients to progress through a complete booking flow from personal details to slot selection with accurate doctor lists and real-time slot generation.

### Database Schema Implementation ✅
**Location**: `supabase/migrations/`
- **Migration 1**: `20250610200700_create_schedules_and_doctor_slots.sql`
  - Created `clinicians` table (equivalent to doctors)
  - Created `clients` table (equivalent to patients)
  - Created `appointments` table with proper foreign keys
  - Created `schedules` table for doctor availability
  - Created `doctor_slots` table for 30-minute time slots
  - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies
  
- **Migration 2**: `20250611210500_fix_schedule_management_tables.sql`
  - Added helper functions: `is_admin()`, `get_user_role()`
  - Enhanced constraints and indexes
  - Optimized slot generation queries

**Key Features**:
- Multi-role authentication (admin, clinician, client)
- 30-minute appointment slot system
- Real-time availability tracking
- Comprehensive RLS security

### Backend Implementation ✅
**Location**: `backend/controllers/slotController.js`

**Core Functions Implemented**:
1. **`generateSlots(doctorId, date)`**
   - Generates 30-minute time slots for specified doctor and date
   - Filters out past time slots for current date
   - Returns availability status for each slot
   - Handles concurrent booking scenarios
   - Includes comprehensive error handling

2. **`getDoctors()`**
   - Fetches list of available clinicians
   - Returns doctor details including specialization
   - Supports filtering and search capabilities

3. **Real-time Slot Updates**
   - Supabase Realtime channel subscription
   - Live slot availability updates
   - Prevents double-booking scenarios

**Routing**: `backend/routes/scheduleRoutes.js`
- GET `/api/slots/:doctorId/:date` - Generate slots
- GET `/api/doctors` - Fetch available doctors
- POST `/api/appointments` - Book appointment
- PUT `/api/slots/:id` - Update slot availability

### Frontend Implementation ✅
**Location**: `frontend/src/`

**Main Booking Component**: `pages/BookAppointment.jsx`
- 4-step booking wizard implementation
- Step 1: Guide/Introduction
- Step 2: Personal Details Form
- Step 3: Doctor & Slot Selection
- Step 4: Review & Confirmation

**Key Components**:
1. **`BookingFormPersonalDetails.jsx`**
   - Comprehensive patient information form
   - Speech recognition for symptoms input
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Medical history collection

2. **`BookingFormSelectSlotsNew.jsx`**
   - Two-step selection process: Doctor → Slot

**Frontend E2E Tests**: `frontend/tests/booking-flow.spec.cjs`
- Complete booking flow testing (Playwright)
- Personal details form validation
- Doctor selection and filtering
- Slot generation and selection
- Real-time updates verification
- Mobile responsive design testing
- Navigation between steps
- Error handling scenarios

**Existing Test Infrastructure**:
- `auth.spec.cjs` - Authentication testing

- `admin-clinicians.spec.cjs` - Clinician management
- Production testing configuration for `https://booksmartly.iplcmiami.com`

### Technical Architecture

**Database Design**:
```sql
clinicians (doctors) → schedules → doctor_slots
clients (patients) → appointments → doctor_slots
```
