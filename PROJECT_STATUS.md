### ‚úÖ Recently Resolved Critical Issues

1. **CRITICAL BACKEND CODE FIX - COMPLETELY RESOLVED** ‚úÖ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**
   - **Root Cause Identified**: Backend code consistently queried non-existent `profiles` table throughout `backend/routes/userRoutes.js`
   - **Database Schema Analysis**: Used Supabase CLI to dump complete schema, confirmed NO `profiles` table exists
   - **Proper Architecture Discovered**: Database follows Supabase best practices with `auth.users` + separate profile tables (`clients`, `clinicians2`) linked via `user_id`
   - **Solution Implemented**: Created helper functions to abstract table selection logic:
     - `getUserProfile(userId)`: Gets user from appropriate table (`clients` or `clinicians2`)
     - `getAllUserProfiles()`: Combines data from both tables with unified structure
     - `checkEmailExists(email)`: Checks email existence across tables
     - `checkPhoneExists(phone)`: Checks phone existence across tables
   - **ALL ROUTES UPDATED**: ‚úÖ Updated ALL 12 routes that were querying non-existent `profiles` table
   - **Git Repository**: ‚úÖ Successfully committed and pushed to GitHub (commit a6cbacd with 405 insertions, 158 deletions)
   - **VPS Deployment**: ‚úÖ Successfully deployed to VPS using git stash/pull, resolved merge conflicts
   - **Backend Service**: ‚úÖ PM2 service restarted successfully, backend running on port 8000
   - **API Verification**: ‚úÖ Confirmed `/api/users/allusers` endpoint returns expected empty array (working correctly)
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETELY FIXED AND DEPLOYED - Backend now uses correct database tables

2. **Supabase CLI Integration - SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**
   - **Installation**: ‚úÖ Supabase CLI locally installed and configured
   - **Project Linking**: ‚úÖ Successfully linked to remote Supabase project
   - **Database Access**: ‚úÖ Direct database access established for schema analysis
   - **Schema Dump**: ‚úÖ Complete database schema dumped to `database_schema.sql`
   - **Migration Analysis**: ‚úÖ Analyzed all migration files to understand proper table structure
   - **Credentials Extraction**: ‚úÖ All Supabase secrets properly configured in local and VPS env files

3. **Git Repository Management - SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**
   - **Repository Initialization**: ‚úÖ Git repository successfully initialized
   - **GitHub Remote**: ‚úÖ Connected to `https://github.com/IPLC-Miami/booksmartly.git`
   - **Critical Commit**: ‚úÖ Backend fixes committed and pushed (commit a6cbacd)
   - **Automatic Deployment**: ‚úÖ VPS webhook deployment working (with manual fallback)
   - **Version Control**: ‚úÖ Proper git workflow established

4. **500 Internal Server Error - COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
   - **Previous Error**: "rewrite or internal redirection cycle while internally redirecting to '/index.html'"
   - **Root Cause**: Escaped dollar signs in nginx configuration variables
   - **Solution**: Removed ALL escaped dollar signs from nginx variables ($server_name, $uri, $host, etc.)
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Website now loads successfully
   - **Verification**: No new redirection errors in nginx logs since fix

5. **Content Security Policy - RESOLVED**
   - **Previous Error**: Google Analytics scripts blocked by CSP directive
   - **Solution**: Added comprehensive CSP header allowing Google Analytics domains
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - CSP now allows all required Google Analytics resources

### üîÑ Current Task In Progress

### üö´ Serena MCP Server Integration Failure

#### Attempted Integration
- **User Request**: Use Serena MCP server for task automation
- **Server Command**: `C:/Users/Peter Darley/.local/bin/uv.exe run --directory C:/Users/Peter Darley/Documents/serena serena-mcp-server --context ide-assistant`
- **Available Tools**: 30+ tools including file operations, symbol finding, code editing, memory management

#### Critical Failure
- **Error**: Timeout during server activation
- **Impact**: Unable to leverage advanced code analysis and editing capabilities
- **Fallback**: Continued with standard tools
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - server failed to respond within timeout period

#### Serena Tools That Could Have Helped
- `find_symbol`: Could have located Supabase configuration issues
- `find_referencing_symbols`: Could have traced environment variable usage
- `replace_symbol_body`: Could have made precise code modifications
- `search_for_pattern`: Could have found all environment variable references
- `think_about_collected_information`: Could have provided better analysis

### üìä Deployment Architecture

#### Current Working Components
- **VPS Server**: Ubuntu with Nginx, PM2, Node.js
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt certificates properly configured
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API running on port 8000
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (backend connection working)
- **Frontend Build**: React/Vite static files served by Nginx

#### Network Flow
```
Internet ‚Üí Nginx (443/SSL) ‚Üí Static Files (/var/www/booksmartly/frontend/dist/)
                          ‚Üí API Proxy (/api/* ‚Üí localhost:8000)
```

### üîÑ Attempted Solutions

#### Supabase Environment Variables
1. **Attempt 1**: Created frontend `.env` file with VITE_ prefixed variables
2. **Attempt 2**: Rebuilt frontend after environment file creation
3. **Attempt 3**: Manually corrected index.html and rebuilt again
4. **Attempt 4**: Fixed Vite configuration and rebuilt with proper base path
5. **Result**: All attempts failed - variables still not recognized

#### Asset Path Resolution
1. **Identified Root Cause**: Vite config `base: "/cureit"` property
2. **Fixed Source Files**: Updated vite.config.js and index.html template
3. **Rebuilt Successfully**: Asset paths now correct
4. **Result**: ‚úÖ Asset loading issues resolved

### üéØ Immediate Next Steps

#### High Priority (Current Tasks)
1. **Complete Frontend Rebuild** (In Progress)
   - ‚úÖ Frontend rebuild command executing on VPS
   - ‚è≥ Wait for build completion
   - ‚è≥ Verify website functionality after rebuild
   - ‚è≥ Test that blank page issue is resolved

2. **Verify Core User Requirements** (Pending Frontend Fix)
   - ‚è≥ Test clinician login and profile access
   - ‚è≥ Test admin login and schedule management functionality
   - ‚è≥ Ensure backend fixes properly support user authentication

3. **End-to-End Functionality Testing** (Pending Frontend Fix)
   - ‚è≥ Test user registration and authentication flows
   - ‚è≥ Verify appointment booking functionality
   - ‚è≥ Test AI consultation features with Google Gemini API

#### Medium Priority (Future Tasks)
4. **Complete TTS Removal**
   - Remove all Text-to-Speech related code as requested
   - Clean up unused dependencies and components

5. **Address Remaining Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Consider upgrading to Vite 6.x to resolve esbuild vulnerabilities (breaking change)
   - Evaluate impact of breaking changes before implementation

6. **Performance Optimization** (Optional)
   - Monitor application performance under load
   - Optimize build output if needed

### üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Vite Environment Variables**: More complex than expected - require specific handling during build process
2. **Asset Path Configuration**: Critical to check both build config AND template files
3. **MCP Server Integration**: Powerful but unreliable - need fallback strategies
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple interconnected systems require systematic debugging
5. **Nginx Variable Syntax**: Escaped dollar signs cause critical redirection loops
