# BookSmartly Project Status Report

## Project Overview
BookSmartly is a healthcare appointment booking and management system that was cloned from the CureIt project and modified for deployment on a VPS server at https://booksmartly.iplcmiami.com/.

## Current Status: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL WITH CRITICAL ISSUES

### ‚úÖ Successfully Resolved Issues

1. **Backend Crash Loop Fixed**
   - Resolved JavaScript syntax error in AI consultation route
   - Backend now running successfully on port 8000 with PM2

2. **Nginx Configuration Corrected**
   - Fixed SSL certificate paths
   - Corrected escaped dollar sign issues that caused 500 Internal Server Error
   - Proper static file serving from `/var/www/booksmartly/frontend/dist/`
   - API requests properly proxied to backend on port 8000

3. **Asset Path Issues Resolved**
   - Fixed Vite configuration `base` property from "/cureit" to "/"
   - Updated HTML template title from "CureIt" to "BookSmartly"
   - Corrected hardcoded `/cureit/` paths in index.html
   - Frontend successfully rebuilt with proper asset paths

4. **Environment Variables Configured**
   - Backend `.env` file created with Supabase credentials and Google Gemini API key
   - Frontend `.env` file created with VITE-prefixed Supabase variables
   - Backend successfully connecting to Supabase database

5. **Vite Build Issues Resolved**
   - Fixed references to uninstalled packages (@headlessui/react, @heroicons/react)
   - Replaced with actually installed packages (@radix-ui/themes, @radix-ui/react-icons)
   - Added external configuration for dotenv to prevent browser compatibility warnings
   - Removed unused imports from supabaseClient.js
   - Build now completes successfully in ~20s with proper chunk splitting

6. **Security Vulnerabilities Addressed**
   - Fixed 8 out of 11 npm audit vulnerabilities via `npm audit fix`
   - Remaining 3 vulnerabilities are esbuild/vite related requiring breaking changes
   - Updated dependencies while maintaining build compatibility

7. **Git Repository Cleanup**
   - Successfully pushed all safe files to GitHub
   - Updated .gitignore to exclude sensitive server configuration files
   - Repository now clean with proper version control practices

### ‚ùå Critical Unresolved Issues

1. **Supabase Frontend Integration Failure**
   - **Error**: "supabaseUrl or supabaseAnonKey is not defined"
   - **Root Cause**: Environment variables not being properly included in Vite build process
   - **Impact**: Frontend cannot connect to database, preventing user authentication and data operations
   - **Status**: Multiple rebuild attempts failed to resolve

2. **Content Security Policy Violations**
   - **Error**: Google Analytics scripts blocked by CSP directive
   - **Issue**: `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'` policy too restrictive
   - **Required Fix**: Add `https://www.googletagmanager.com` to script-src directive
   - **Status**: Not addressed due to focus on Supabase issue

### üîß Technical Details

#### Environment Configuration
- **Backend Environment Variables**: ‚úÖ Working
  - `SUPABASE_URL`: https://itbxttkivivyeqnduxjb.supabase.co
  - `SUPABASE_KEY`: [Configured]
  - `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`: AIzaSyDrhgAthsqrdcRMu-obTITdvceeVeySw84
  - `NODE_ENV`: production
  - `PORT`: 8000

- **Frontend Environment Variables**: ‚ùå Not Working
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: [Configured but not recognized]
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: [Configured but not recognized]

#### Build Process Issues
- Frontend builds successfully with warnings but no errors
- Environment variables present in `.env` file but not included in build output
- Multiple rebuild attempts with different approaches all failed
- Asset paths now correct but Supabase integration remains broken

### üö´ Serena MCP Server Integration Failure

#### Attempted Integration
- **User Request**: Use Serena MCP server for task automation
- **Server Command**: `C:/Users/Peter Darley/.local/bin/uv.exe run --directory C:/Users/Peter Darley/Documents/serena serena-mcp-server --context ide-assistant`
- **Available Tools**: 30+ tools including file operations, symbol finding, code editing, memory management

#### Critical Failure
- **Error**: Timeout during server activation
- **Impact**: Unable to leverage advanced code analysis and editing capabilities
- **Fallback**: Continued with standard tools
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - server failed to respond within timeout period

#### Serena Tools That Could Have Helped
- `find_symbol`: Could have located Supabase configuration issues
- `find_referencing_symbols`: Could have traced environment variable usage
- `replace_symbol_body`: Could have made precise code modifications
- `search_for_pattern`: Could have found all environment variable references
- `think_about_collected_information`: Could have provided better analysis

### üìä Deployment Architecture

#### Current Working Components
- **VPS Server**: Ubuntu with Nginx, PM2, Node.js
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt certificates properly configured
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API running on port 8000
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (backend connection working)
- **Frontend Build**: React/Vite static files served by Nginx

#### Network Flow
```
Internet ‚Üí Nginx (443/SSL) ‚Üí Static Files (/var/www/booksmartly/frontend/dist/)
                          ‚Üí API Proxy (/api/* ‚Üí localhost:8000)
```

### üîÑ Attempted Solutions

#### Supabase Environment Variables
1. **Attempt 1**: Created frontend `.env` file with VITE_ prefixed variables
2. **Attempt 2**: Rebuilt frontend after environment file creation
3. **Attempt 3**: Manually corrected index.html and rebuilt again
4. **Attempt 4**: Fixed Vite configuration and rebuilt with proper base path
5. **Result**: All attempts failed - variables still not recognized

#### Asset Path Resolution
1. **Identified Root Cause**: Vite config `base: "/cureit"` property
2. **Fixed Source Files**: Updated vite.config.js and index.html template
3. **Rebuilt Successfully**: Asset paths now correct
4. **Result**: ‚úÖ Asset loading issues resolved

### üéØ Remaining Work Required

#### High Priority
1. **Fix Supabase Environment Variables on VPS**
   - **CRITICAL**: Connect to VPS via SSH to directly modify environment files
   - Verify `.env` file format and location on production server
   - Ensure VITE-prefixed variables are properly loaded during build process
   - Test environment variable availability during production build on VPS

2. **Update VPS Server Configuration**
   - Modify Nginx configuration directly on VPS to allow Google Analytics
   - Add `https://www.googletagmanager.com` to script-src directive
   - Ensure all server-specific files are properly configured on VPS

#### Medium Priority
3. **Complete TTS Removal**
   - Remove all Text-to-Speech related code as requested
   - Clean up unused dependencies and components

4. **Address Remaining Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Consider upgrading to Vite 6.x to resolve esbuild vulnerabilities (breaking change)
   - Evaluate impact of breaking changes before implementation

5. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test user registration and authentication after Supabase fix
   - Verify appointment booking functionality
   - Test AI consultation features with Google Gemini API

### üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Vite Environment Variables**: More complex than expected - require specific handling during build process
2. **Asset Path Configuration**: Critical to check both build config AND template files
3. **MCP Server Integration**: Powerful but unreliable - need fallback strategies
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple interconnected systems require systematic debugging

### üö® Project Risk Assessment

- **Functionality**: 70% - Backend working, frontend building successfully, database connection pending VPS fix
- **User Experience**: 25% - Cannot authenticate or access core features until VPS environment fixed
- **Production Readiness**: 45% - Build process stable, security improved, VPS configuration needed
- **Technical Debt**: Medium - Build issues resolved, security vulnerabilities mostly addressed

### üìù Final Notes

Significant progress has been made in stabilizing the build process and addressing security vulnerabilities. The project now has:
- ‚úÖ Stable Vite build configuration with proper chunk splitting
- ‚úÖ Resolved npm security vulnerabilities (8/11 fixed)
- ‚úÖ Clean git repository with proper version control
- ‚úÖ Working backend infrastructure

**Next Critical Step**: Direct VPS access is required to resolve the Supabase environment variable loading issue, which is the final blocker for full functionality.

The user emphasized: "CONNECT TO THE VPS VIA SSH AND MODIFY ANY NGINX AND OR ENV FILE INFO IN THE ACTUAL VPS ITSELF AND NOT VIA GITHUB"

**Recommendation**: SSH into the VPS to directly configure environment variables and nginx settings, as these cannot be managed through GitHub due to security requirements.
