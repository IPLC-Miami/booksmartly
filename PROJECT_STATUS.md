   - **Database Schema Analysis**: Used Supabase CLI to dump complete schema, confirmed NO `profiles` table exists
   - **Proper Architecture Discovered**: Database follows Supabase best practices with `auth.users` + separate profile tables (`clients`, `clinicians2`) linked via `user_id`
   - **Solution Implemented**: Created helper functions to abstract table selection logic:
     - `getUserProfile(userId)`: Gets user from appropriate table (`clients` or `clinicians2`)
     - `getAllUserProfiles()`: Combines data from both tables with unified structure
     - `checkEmailExists(email)`: Checks email existence across tables
     - `checkPhoneExists(phone)`: Checks phone existence across tables
   - **ALL ROUTES UPDATED**: ‚úÖ Updated ALL 12 routes that were querying non-existent `profiles` table
   - **Git Repository**: ‚úÖ Successfully committed and pushed to GitHub (commit a6cbacd with 405 insertions, 158 deletions)
   - **VPS Deployment**: ‚úÖ Successfully deployed to VPS using git stash/pull, resolved merge conflicts
   - **Backend Service**: ‚úÖ PM2 service restarted successfully, backend running on port 8000
   - **API Verification**: ‚úÖ Confirmed `/api/users/allusers` endpoint returns expected empty array (working correctly)
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETELY FIXED AND DEPLOYED - Backend now uses correct database tables

2. **Supabase CLI Integration - SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**
   - **Installation**: ‚úÖ Supabase CLI locally installed and configured
   - **Project Linking**: ‚úÖ Successfully linked to remote Supabase project

   - **Automatic Deployment**: ‚úÖ VPS webhook deployment working (with manual fallback)
   - **Version Control**: ‚úÖ Proper git workflow established

4. **500 Internal Server Error - COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
   - **Previous Error**: "rewrite or internal redirection cycle while internally redirecting to '/index.html'"
   - **Root Cause**: Escaped dollar signs in nginx configuration variables
   - **Solution**: Removed ALL escaped dollar signs from nginx variables ($server_name, $uri, $host, etc.)
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Website now loads successfully
   - **Verification**: No new redirection errors in nginx logs since fix

5. **Content Security Policy - RESOLVED**
   - **Previous Error**: Google Analytics scripts blocked by CSP directive

### üîÑ Current Task In Progress

1. **CRITICAL: Dashboard Blank Page Issue - DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - **Issue Identified**: Dashboard loads blank page after successful authentication with admin credentials (`iplcmiami@gmail.com` / `Iplc2353!`)
   - **Root Cause**: Dashboard component only renders when `role` state is set, but role determination process is failing silently
   - **Authentication Status**: ‚úÖ Login works correctly, token stored properly, ProtectedRoutes allows access
   - **Current Action**: ‚úÖ Enhanced Dashboard component with comprehensive debugging, loading states, and error handling
   - **Debug Features Added**: Loading spinner, error messages, retry functionality, detailed console logging
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Debugging code deployed to main branch (commit f5d5c5f)
   - **Next Steps**: Test login with admin credentials and analyze console output to identify role determination failure

2. **Git Repository Branch Cleanup - COMPLETED** ‚úÖ **CRITICAL SUCCESS**
   - **Issue**: Repository had multiple unnecessary branches (`master`, `online-appointments`)
   - **Action Taken**: ‚úÖ Deleted obsolete `master` branch from remote repository
   - **Action Taken**: ‚úÖ Cleaned up local remote tracking references
   - **Current Branches**: Only `main` (working branch) and `gh-pages` (deployment) remain
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Repository now clean with proper branch structure
   - **Prevention**: All future work will be done on main branch only

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues to Address

   - **Current Issue**: Dashboard loads blank page because `role` state never gets set
   - **Authentication**: ‚úÖ Working correctly - login successful, token stored properly
   - **Routing**: ‚úÖ Working correctly - ProtectedRoutes allows access to dashboard
   - **Root Cause**: Role fetching process (useUserRoleById, useGetCurrentUser) failing silently
   - **Status**: üîÑ Enhanced debugging deployed, awaiting test results
   - **Priority**: Critical - Blocking all dashboard functionality

2. **Backend API Role Determination** (Investigation Required)
   - **Requirement**: Verify `getUserRoleById` API endpoint returns proper role data
   - **Requirement**: Confirm user role exists in database for admin account `iplcmiami@gmail.com`
   - **Status**: ‚è≥ Pending dashboard debug output analysis
   - **Priority**: Critical - Required for dashboard functionality

3. **Source Map and URL Encoding Issues** (Secondary Priority)
   - **Issue**: Browser dev tools show source map errors and malformed URLs (`/user/%3Canonymous%20code%3E`)
   - **Status**: ‚è≥ Lower priority than dashboard functionality
   - **Priority**: Medium - Affects development experience
